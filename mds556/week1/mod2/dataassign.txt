Hide Description
The file Some Random Numbers to Play With contains 20,000 random numbers generated by a high quality method from Random.org. They have been arranged, maintaining full randomness, into 1,000 rows with 20 columns in each row.

These data can be viewed in two fundamentally different ways. One approach is to consider them as twenty columns or features with 1000 data points for each. The other is to view them as 1,000 rows or features with 20 data points each.

Explore the behavior of correlations using each of the two views. Describe any patterns or surprises you observe in these correlations, especially given that these data are highly random. How do your observations fir with Granville's first article?

Optional: Explore some of the data sources in the Spurious Correlations piece, or other data sources if you wish, using some of the alternative approaches to correlation. If you use Granville's t, you'll need to do some coding. Can you identify circumstances in which the non-parametric approach might better inform a model than the traditional Pearson's R?
